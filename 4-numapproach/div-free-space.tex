\section{Divergence-free FE space}
The divergence-free constraint of the magnetic field, $\bfB = 0$ (Gauss's law) is not enforced by the solution definition \ref{weakSlnDef}. Therefore, we need to perform additional work to be sure that we do not have a non-physical solution in the sense that the contstraint is not satisfied.
\paragraph{}
There are two often used approaches to handle this problem - the Constraint-Transport (CT) method, and divergence cleaning. The first one is not suitable for this work, as it constraints the triangulation in such a way, that implementing Adaptive Mesh Refinement would be very complicated, if possible at all. The second approach, the divergence cleaning method, ... (TODO doplnit).
