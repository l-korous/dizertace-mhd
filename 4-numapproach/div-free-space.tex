\section{Divergence-free FE space}
The divergence-free constraint of the magnetic field, $\bfB = 0$ (Gauss's law) is not enforced by the solution definition \ref{weakSlnDef}. Therefore, we need to perform additional work to be sure that we do not have a non-physical solution in the sense that the constraint is not satisfied.
\paragraph{}
There are two often used approaches to handle this problem - the Constraint-Transport (CT) method, and divergence cleaning. The first one is not suitable for this work, as it constraints the triangulation in such a way, that implementing Adaptive Mesh Refinement would be very complicated, if possible at all. The second approach, the divergence cleaning methods need additional postprocessing step which may be omitted for the sake of calculation efficiency. The approach taken in this work is to replace the standard FE space
