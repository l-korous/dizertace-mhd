\section{Time-stepping and linearization}
Since the equations in question are evolution equations (they contain the time derivative), the time stepping need to be somehow tackled. And since the equations are nonlinear, to avoid the necessity of using an (iterative) nonlinear solver for each time step, an explicit time-stepping, leading to a linearization of these equations is preferred.
\subsection{Time-stepping}
The simple time discretization scheme that we use in \cref{section:discreteProblem} allows us to simply implement the time-stepping in the following fashion:\\
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\textbf{    Set: }$y_0 =\ $ (initial solution)\\
\textbf{    Set: }$ts = 1 $ \# initial time step\\
\textbf{    Set: }$t = 0.00 $ \# initial time\\
    \# Loop over time steps\\
    \For{$;\ t < T;\ t = t+\tau,\ ts = ts + 1$}{
        \KwData{Solution from the previous time step $y^{ts - 1}$}
1.Call procedure \cref{algorithm:singleTimeStep} to obtain $A, b\lo y^{ts - 1}\ro$\\
2.Solve the problem $Ay^{ts} = b\lo y^{ts - 1}\ro\ $ \# See note below\\
3.(If necessary) postprocess $y^{ts}$ using \cref{algorithm:limiter}\\
4.Calculate updated value of $\tau$ using \cref{equation:CFLcond}\\

\label{note:solvers}
The step 2 (solving the algebraic problem) is of course a key point in the overall process. Because of its importance, the aim of this work is not to describe, or even implement an algebraic solver for this purpose. Many scientific teams have spent many years on publicly available open-source solvers that are usable by the software we develop for the purpose of solving the MHD phenomena. We use the existing solvers.
