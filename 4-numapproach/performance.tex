\section{Performance considerations}
Since eventually results are obtained by running a (distributed) program that implements the numerical methods, it is important to focus also on the performance aspects of the implementation, and not only on the numerical schemes. Plainly put, even a very efficient numerical algorithm can run on a computer a very long time, if not implemented properly.
