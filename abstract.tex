\noindent Abstract:
The objective of this Doctoral Thesis was to develop, implement and test new algorithms for the large-scale solution of nonstationary compressible MHD equations based on higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. The basis for the new methods will be the discontinuous Galerkin methods and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithms. The new algorithms will be implemented and tested in the framework of the open source library Deal.II, and they will be applied to selected problems of MHD in astrophysics, namely the magnetic reconnection phenomena. \\

\noindent Keywords: numerical simulation, finite element method, MHD equations, adaptivity, discontinuous Galerkin method, astrophysics, solar flares, CME, magnetic reconnection
