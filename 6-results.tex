\chapter{Results}
In this section, results from the computation using the implemented software are presented. There are two classical benchmarks for 3-dimensional MHD equations, namely the MHD Blast \cite{blast1}, \cite{blast2}, and the Orszag-Tang vortex \cite{vortex}. And then the main section of this work contains results from the flux rope eruption model on and above the Sun's surface.

\section{Benchmarks}
The benchmarks presented in this Section do not have an exact analytical solution, but the formation of waves and discontinuities is well studied, and benchmarking is usually performed on the basis of comparing the structure and presence of non-physical attributes.
