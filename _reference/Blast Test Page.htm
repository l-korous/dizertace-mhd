<h2>Reference:</h2>

<p>
Various papers have presented results from similar spherical blast wave tests,
e.g. Zachary, Malagoli, A., &amp; Colella,P., SIAM J. Sci. Comp., 15, 263 (1994);
Balsara, D., &amp; Spicer, D., JCP 149, 270 (1999); Londrillo, P. &amp; Del Zanna, L.,
ApJ 530, 508 (2000).

<h2>Description:</h2>
</dl>
<p>
Different authors set this problem up in different ways.  To test Athena,
we used a rectangular domain, -0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.5; -0.75 ≤ y ≤ 0.75.
The boundary
conditions are periodic everywhere.  This non-square domain and periodic
boundary conditions produces complex shock-shock and shock-CD interactions
at late times.
</p>
<p>
The initial
density is 1.0, the pressure is 0.1, and the gas constant
is γ = 5/3.  Initial velocities are zero everywhere.  Within the
region r &lt; 0.1, the pressure is set to 10.0 (that is, 100 times the ambient
pressure).  For the MHD problem,
the initial magnetic field is uniform everywhere with
B<sub>x</sub> / (4π)<sup>1/2</sup> = B<sub>y</sub> / (4π)<sup>1/2</sup>
= 1/√2.

<h2>What's important about this test?</h2>
</dl>
<p>
To be honest, this test is not very quantitative, but makes great movies!
</p>
<p>
At early times, it is important that the out-going blast wave is
spherical and shows no grid alignment effects.
</p>
<p>
At late times, the interaction of the blast wave with the CD at the
edge of the evacuated bubble in the center produces filaments of dense
gas by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.  It is important these fingers
are sharp and not diffused away.  Moreover, for the hydrodynamical
problem, the pattern of the fingers
should be EXACTLY symmetric top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
For the MHD problem, the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is suppressed, and no
fingers are evident.

<h2>Results: 2D Hydrodynamical Blast</h2>
</dl>

<p>
Results computed with Athena using the HLLC solver and the third
order algorithm on a 400x600 grid are shown
below.  The images show the density on a linear color map between 0.08
and 6.5.  The image on the left is at t = 0.2, the image on the right
is at t = 1.5
</p>

<p>
Note the pattern of dense fingers in the interior produced by the
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is exactly symmetric.

<h2>Results: 2D MHD Blast</h2>
</dl>

<p>
Results computed with Athena using the Roe solver and the third
order algorithm on a 400x600 grid are shown
below.  The images show the density on a linear color map between 0.08
and 6.5.  The image on the left is at t = 0.2, the image on the right
is at t = 1.0
</p>

<p>
Note the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is supressed by the magnetic
field, and no fingers are evident in the interior of the bubble.  Also
note the bubble is strongly aligned along the magnetic field.
