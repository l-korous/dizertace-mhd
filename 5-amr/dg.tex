\section{Adaptive-mesh refinement and DG}
With the Discontinuous Galerkin method, using AMR brings additional complexity into the evaluation of face integrals described in \Cref{Final_Integration_Fn_b}, \Cref{singleNumIntBface}.
To describe the process in detail, definition of the numerical flux \Cref{NumFluxDef} needs to be taken into account. What is evaluated during the assembling procedure \Cref{algorithm:singleTimeStep} is the term \Cref{singleNumIntBface}. In order to evaluate it, we need to consider values of the solution in quadrature points $\left\{\bfx^{ij}_1, ..., \bfx^{ij}_{\bfn_f}\right\}$ from both sides of $\Gamma_{ij}\in \Gamma_I$, that is from the two neighboring elements $K^i\in T, K^j\in T$. For $\Gamma_{ij}\in \Gamma_B$ the situation is obviously simpler as is not discussed further.
\paragraph{}
What needs to be evaluated is in fact the term
\be
\mrH\lo{\mrPsi_h^{k}}|_{ij}\lo\bfx\ro, {\mrPsi_h^{k}}|_{ji}\lo\bfx\ro, \bfn_{ij}\lo\bfx\ro\ro
\ee
If the two neighboring elements are of the same size as in \Cref{TODO}, calculation of this term from algorithmic perspective is performed as follows:\\
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\KwData{$K^i\in T_h$}
\KwData{$\Gamma_{ij}\in \Gamma_I\ $ a face of $K^i$}

\end{algorithm}

If however, the two neighboring elements are not of the same size, situation gets more complicated. Note that for this work, the level of uniform refinement of the hexahedron $K_i$ must differ from the level of uniform refinement of any neighboring element $K_j$ with which it shares a common face $\Gamma_{ij}$ at most by one. This means that the situation when neighboring elements are not of the same side looks always as in \Cref{TODO}, but $K_i$ can be on either side of $\Gamma_{ij}$ as indicated in \Cref{TODO}.

\subsection{Periodic boundary conditions}
\label{amrPer}
Handling with periodic boundary conditions with AMR is primarily difficult because of implications for mesh partitioning - additional ghost cells need to be added to cells on boundaries with the periodic condition - in order to perform steps 1 and 2 in \Cref{algorithm:numFluxSimple}.

\subsection{Relationship with slope limiters}
As a key step in the slope limiting algorithm \Cref{algorithm:limiter} is forming the set of all elements $K_{\bfv} = \left\{K^{'}\in T\ |\ \bfv \text{is a vertex of} K\right\}$ for a particular vertex $\bfv$, and as this step tends to be rather expensive for distributed triangulations (which have different topology than vertex-based), caching of the already obtained mappings between the vertex $\bfv$ and the set $K_{\bfv}$ is employed. Of course with every mesh refinement, a lot of these cached values need to be forgotten.
\paragraph{}
In reality, after each mesh refinement step, there follows a step of redistributing the mesh (to have roughly equal number of elements owned by each processors - that is to avoid bottlenecks where one processors would do a significant portion of all processing and other processors would idly wait for it to finish assembling). This means that carefully computing which entries in such a cache must be forgotten and which not would be very tedious and complex - that is why, for pragmatic reasons, after each refinement step, the entire cache is flushed. But in order not to suffer from slope limiting being a costly operation, the mesh refinement is performed only in every $n$-th time step. Another reason to do so is that with the unchanged mesh, the algebraic solver can keep the once computed matrix structures and data alike, which again saves computational time.
