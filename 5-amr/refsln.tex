\section{Reference solution approach}
As the aim of this work is to prepare a universally usable solver for MHD problems, the refinement indicator \Cref{refinementIndicator} must ideally not be dependent on any attributes of the solved problem data (initial condition, boundary conditions, physical quantities such as $\gamma$, etc.). In order to achieve this, the so-called{reference solution} approach is used.
\paragraph{}
The reference solution approach is not only problem, but also equation (physics) independent, which is truly invaluable for many types of physical problems, even so for multi-physics coupled problems, such as MHD.

TODO - add outputs (Hermes / deal)
TODO - ukazat na 2d prikladu z Hermesu co to je referencni reseni, co to je ||zprojektovane - presne|| (v dealu?), co to je tohle bez normy, zminka o distribuovanosti, ze musim napocitat nejaky thresholdy mapReducem, atd.
