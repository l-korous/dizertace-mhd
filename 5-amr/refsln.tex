\section{Reference solution approach}
As the aim of this work is to prepare a universally usable solver for MHD problems, the refinement indicator \Cref{refinementIndicator} must ideally not be dependent on any attributes of the solved problem data (initial condition, boundary conditions, physical quantities such as $\gamma$, etc.). In order to achieve this, the so-called{reference solution} approach is used.
