\subsection{Numerical simulation of MHD Phenomena}
Only recently, the scientific computation community, due to the advances in computer and supercomputer capabilities, has started with non-trivial numerical simulations of such complex physical phenomena that the MHD model describes. Since both for industrial applications, and obviously for astrophysical application of the MHD model, it is quite expensive (or downright impossible) to perform any experiments, the benefit of being able to simulate the phenomena on a computer is very large.
