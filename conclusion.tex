\chapter{Conclusion, outlook}
Further work will focus on real-world industrial and astrophysical problems, mainly study of the magnetic field reconnection - \citep{reconnection}, and other phenomena occurring both in solar physics and in industrial applications of plasma flow. Next step is solidification of the implemented algorithm, and comparison of several numerical fluxes. After the implementation is stable for the benchmark presented here, and as well as additional benchmarks (such as Orszag-Tang Vortex - \citep{vortex}), next step is distributed calculation of larger real-world problems and further work on performance improvements. Step after that is adding of additional physics into the implementation, mainly in the form of magnetic reconnection models.
