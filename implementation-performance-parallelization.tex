\subsection{Parallelization}
- tady vyuzit to co jsem delal na predmet\\
To be able to perform any large scale calculations, we need to be able to utilize the performance of hardware at maximum. Being able to use modern, multi-core computers is an absolute must to achieve good performance, as the execution time can decrease by a factor of 10 or more.

The parallelization is possible at several places in the overall algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluation of integrals - numerical integration - possible to be done in a number of elements in parallel
\item Solving the resulting linear algebraic problem - the solution can be performed in parallel
\end{itemize}
