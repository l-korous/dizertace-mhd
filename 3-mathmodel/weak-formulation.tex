\section{Weak formulation of the problem}
The DG method is defined by first considering the weak formulation of the equations \cref{conservativeGeneric} obtained by multiplying the equations at every time instance $t$ by a (vector-valued) test function $\mrv\in W_t$, where $W_t$ is a suitable space of (vector-valued) functions $W_t = \lo W_1, ..., W_8\ro$, integrating over the space domain $\Omega_{t}$, and performing integration by parts.
We start with multiplying \cref{conservativeGeneric} by a test function:
\be
\pds{\mrPsi}{t} \mrv + \lo\nabla \cdot \mrF\lo\mrPsi\ro\ro \mrv = \mrS \mrv,
\ee
then we integrate over $\Omega_{t}$:
\be
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \pds{\mrPsi}{t} \mrv + \int_{\Omega_{t}} \lo\nabla \cdot \mrF\lo\mrPsi\ro\ro \mrv = \int_{\Omega_{t}} \mrS \mrv,
\ee
and finally we integrate by parts:
\be
\label{WeakFinal} \int_{\Omega_{t}} \pds{\mrPsi}{t} \mrv - \int_{\Omega_{t}}\mrF\lo\mrPsi\ro \lo\nabla \cdot \mrv\ro + \int_{\partial\Omega_{t}} \lo\mrF\lo\mrPsi\ro \cdot \bfn \ro\mrv = \int_{\Omega_{t}} \mrS \mrv,
\ee
where the terms $\mrF\lo\mrPsi\ro \lo\nabla \cdot \mrv\ro; \lo\mrF\lo\mrPsi\ro \cdot \bfn \ro\mrv$ are meant as a component-wise multiplication.
\paragraph{}
Now without going into detail, we can conclude, that a suitable space $W$ would be
\be
\label{Sobolev} W_t = \left[H^{1}\lo\Omega_t\ro\right]^8,
\ee
and we shall look for a solution to the \cref{WeakFinal} in the same space $W_t$ at every time instance $t$. We shall not relax the requirement for continuity of time-derivatives we imposed for the \textit{hard solution} \cref{HardSln} for reasons discussed later, and we arrive at the following Bochner space in which we are looking for a weak solution of \cref{conservativeGeneric}:
\be
\label{Bochner} W = C^{1}\lo\lo0, T\ro, W_t\ro.
\ee

To sum up we can define the \textit{weak solution $\mrPsi = \mrPsi\lo(t, \bfx\ro)$} of MHD equations \cref{conservativeGeneric} as

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|l| } 
        \hline
		$\mrPsi\lo(t, \bfx\ro) \in W$ defined in \cref{Bochner}.\\
    \cref{WeakFinal} holds for all $t\in\lo0, T\ro$, and all $\mrv\in W_t$.\\
    $\mrPsi\lo0, \bfx\ro = \Pi \mrPsi^0\lo\bfx\ro$.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

In \cref{weakSlnDef}, $\Pi$ is a projection of the initial condition $\mrPsi^0$ onto $W_0$.
